This hack will force HTML links, within the main content body of a page, to 
open in a new tab.

#### Considerations

This works via JavaScript, so is not assured to run since a user could have
JavaScript disabled although this is relatively rare.

#### Code

{{<hack file="head.html" type="head">}}
